# An F = 68 witness for Erdős Problem #409

Certificates and code verifying

$$
F(6{,}148{,}888{,}817)=68
$$

for the iteration

$$
T(n)=\varphi(n)+1.
$$

Here $F(p)=0$ when $p$ is prime, and for composite $n$,

$$
F(n)=1+F(T(n)).
$$

Starting from

$$
6{,}148{,}888{,}817
=
75{,}503 \times 81{,}439,
$$

the trajectory first reaches a prime after exactly 68 applications of $T$.

The terminal prime is

$$
9{,}500{,}401.
$$

## Minimal verification

The verification program is contained in [`verify.py`](verify.py).

From a terminal opened in this repository, run:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python verify.py
```

Expected output:

```text
68 9500401
```

The complete verification code is:

```python
from sympy import isprime, totient


def main() -> None:
    n = 6_148_888_817
    steps = 0

    while not isprime(n):
        n = int(totient(n)) + 1
        steps += 1

    print(steps, n)

    if (steps, n) != (68, 9_500_401):
        raise RuntimeError(
            f"Unexpected result: expected (68, 9500401), got ({steps}, {n})"
        )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Scope of the result

This establishes the explicit computational lower bound

$$
\sup_{n\ge1}F(n)\ge68.
$$

It is a computational partial result related to [Erdős Problem #409](https://www.erdosproblems.com/409).

It does **not** resolve the broader questions concerning:

- upper bounds for $F(n)$;
- whether infinitely many integers reach the same terminal prime;
- the density of integers reaching a fixed prime.

I am not currently aware of a previously published example with $F\ge68$.
